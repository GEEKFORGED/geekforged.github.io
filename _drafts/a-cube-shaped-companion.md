(Insert image of cube here....)

Have you ever fallen down an Internet rabbit hole? Well it appears that I did. What I discovered this time, visiting Alice in her wonderland; is an art form that goes by the name of Pepakura. Pepakura is promptly named after the piece of Japanese software that is used to make the art. The software takes a 3D model as input and slices it into appropriate pieces allowing you to print it out to make paper models. As if that is not cool enough, you can then fiberglass the model to make it solid. People actually make cosplay armor using this technique.

Naturally when I learned that I could make 3D paper models, my mind exploded. I began to think of all of the possibilities. I had decided that I wanted to make the Ghost from Destiny. I downloaded a file that I found on the Internet for it and began to analyze all of the minuscule pieces that would need to be made. It was that moment that I decided to dial it back a bit. I began to think of things that might be easier to make as a first attempt. What I finally decided on is the Companion Cube from Portal. Surprisingly even though the Companion Cube is, well... mostly a cube; there is still a ton of work that needs to go into making the model.

## Getting the Pepakura software


### What you will need:
* Arduino (of course!)
* USB A-B cable
