So, you finally went out and got yourself an Arduino. I believe congratulations are in order. Now, if you don't have one; go get one so I can congratulate you.

Are you ready to start your very first Arduino project? Well, there is a little bit of setup required on your computer before we can start. Besides, now is a really good time to make sure your Arduino is functioning as it should, before we start diving into some awesome projects.

### What you will need:
* Arduino (of course!)
* USB A-B cable
* Computer or Laptop

### Getting the software
Go to the [Arduino.cc][arduino_cc] site and navigate to the download page. You should see the latest stable version of their software near or at the top of the page. Select your operating system of preference. Feel free to throw them a donation. If you don't want to, they understand, click the "just download" button.

### Installing the software
Assuming that your download was successful go ahead and install the software. Note: if you have any issues installing the software, checkout their official [getting started guide][arduino_cc_getting_started] and select your operating system. If you can't find solace there, hit up Google; it's never failed me yet. Besides if you are experiencing an issue, when it comes to Arduino, chances are someone else already ran into it and found a solution.

### Setting up your environment
Go ahead and open up the Arduino application if it is not already open. In the tool-bar at the top, you will see a "Tools" menu. Click it, then in the sub-menu that opens up click "Board". Select your board from that menu. The board I have is an Uno, so I selected "Arduino/Genuino Uno". Now, make sure that your Arduino board is not plgged into your computer via the USB cable. If it is, unplug it.
