Life can get busy, and when life gets busy we tend to fall off of the wagon. This past week, I finally decided to get off my butt and stop falling off the wagon. Those of you that have followed me for a while know that I average about two videos on YouTube each year. I am aiming to change this for the better. There was a point in time where I had the goal of making one video per week. Well lets be honest here... that never happened. I let life get in the way a little to much and believe it or not, one video a week is a daunting task.

With the few videos I did make, I learned that editing was actually the most time consuming task. This happens to be especially true when you feel the need to tweak every little detail in post production. Of course after you tweak it multiple times, you generally end up with what you started out with any ways. With that in mind, I'm hoping to try to do something bi-weekly. This means that unlike my last (failed) attempt, I need more structure. I really dug deep to find what it is in life that interests me, soul searching if you will. Believe it or not, even though you are usually surrounded by what you like, or what interests you, it can be hard for you to realize or pinpoint what it is that you truly like.

Recently I discovered that I really enjoy teaching people. I love seeing that moment when it just clicks and they get it. It also happens that the "maker movement" really interests me. Now the "maker movement" is quite possibly the most broad topic that one could choose. However, within that topic I tend to excel in the aspects of software engineering and electronics. About a week ago, I discovered one of most amazing ways that I could marry the two together.

It just so happens that on that particular day, I had stopped into the local Radio Shack looking for some odds and ends. While I was there, I stumbled upon a shelf with a dusty old box on it. Upon further inspection, I realized that it was an Arduino starter kit. To clarify, I had heard of Arduinos before but I never gave them much thought. Looking at the kit, the gears began to turn in my head, I began to think of all of the awesome projects that I could make with it. When I went to check out, the cashier told me that the Arduino kit had been there for almost two years. It's almost as if it was waiting for me.

Fast forward half an hour and I'm home, box open, software installed and ready to go. Then I thought, I have this bag of parts, and no real path on where to go, or what to do with them. Of course, I do have minimal prior electronics experience and past software development experience but I found myself wondering what I should do first with my bag of parts. I noticed that the box referenced a getting started book, so I went online and got a copy. To shorten the story a bit, I ended up burning through the rest of my afternoon creating the projects in that book, reading it cover to cover.

This experience inspired me. I had a lot of fun creating the projects in the book. In fact, my girlfriend did as well and her background contains zero technical experience. It was actually really fun being able to teach her something from my world. We started out with the blinking LED project and went from there. In your adventures, you will find that there is something really rewarding about controlling hardware with software, building something from essentially nothing. This, is exactly the direction that I aim to take my channel in. I'm going to teach people (hopefully you) electronics and software engineering, through various projects and tutorials.

Now, you might be wondering why I created this site to tell you all of this. You might be thinking "just get to making the videos already". While I completely understand where you would be coming from, I also realize that videos are not always the best method for explaining things. So this site will exist to supplement and compliment those videos.

Be sure to look for the first project/tutorial in the coming weeks as I am currently working to figure out a format for them. Also, feel free to suggest topics or even projects that you would like to see done! As always, the best way to know what I am up to, or to get a hold of me is on [Twitter][twitter_link].
