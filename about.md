My name is Dylan, and I am a Maker. Wait, this isn't an AA meeting, oh... okay.

Seriously, I enjoy tinkering. The art of making and breaking things, and even turning them into Franken-projects. I also happen to enjoy teaching, and that is primarily what this site is about, so go ahead have fun: break things, make things and learn something along the way!

If you are interested in what I'm doing, and why wouldn't you be? Go ahead and give me a follow on twitter as [@GeekForged][twitter_link]. Want even more? Perhaps you just don't like twitter, jump straight into my videos on [YouTube][youtube_link]. Oh, so you say you don't do the whole YouTube thing, well then you can just follow this site the old fashion way, by pointing your feed reeder to the [RSS Feed][rss_link].
